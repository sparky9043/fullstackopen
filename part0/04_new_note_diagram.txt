  user clicks on input form
  user enters data in input form
  user clicks save
  end user

  Note right of user: The browser makes a post request when user clicks the save button and the form gets submitted to the server with the user input

  browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
  activate server
  server pushes user submitted data to notes array
  server->>browser: Redirect to /exampleapp/notes
  end server

  Note right of server: The server receives the post request to exampleapp/new_note. This post request also includes a payload of the user input. Then the server adds the user input into the notes array as an object with content and data properties. Then it responds with HTTP status code 302. This triggers a redirect, where the server asks the browser to perform a GET request to the address specified in the location, which in this case is /exampleapp/notes

  browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
  activate server
  server->>browser: HTML Document
  end server

  Note right of browser: The redirect to the new_notes now causes the get request to the link, reloading the page with the new note submitted by the browser. This causes three more HTTP requests for the css file, js file and the raw data of notes.

  browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
  activate server
  server->> browser: main.css file
  end server

  browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
  activate server
  server->>browser: main.js file
  end server

  Note right of browser: The browser executes the JS code that gets the updated JSON file from the server

  browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
  activate server
  server->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ..., { "content": "New Note", "date": "2025-05-27" } ]
  deactivate server

  Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the updated notes, which should contain the last updated note submitted by the user.
