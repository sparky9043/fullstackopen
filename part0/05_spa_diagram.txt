  activate server
  server->>browser: spa.js file
  deactivate

  Note on right of browser: Unlike traditional multipage, the js file will not redirect the page. Instead, it will decouple the process between the post request and the rerendering of the UI.

  browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
  activate server
  server->>browser: JSON file returned
  deactivate

  Note: Up to here, there is almost no difference between traditional HTML webpage and the SPA page. The main difference will occur when submitting the form.
